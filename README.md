447 Individual project 1 Readme

Only one terminal is needed to run the program.

The server should run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ but if the link is different when the server is started in the 
terminal, use that

** 'templates' folder with all html files must be in the same directory as main.py and app.db otherwise the program
will not work!!**

Steps to run program:

	1. Open project folder in desired IDE, I used pycharm and vscode to test, and navigate to inside of root 
	   directory /447_individual_project1/
	
	2. Use 'pip list' to check if correct libraries are installed and pip install them if otherwise

	3. Python Dependencies/program requirements include:
